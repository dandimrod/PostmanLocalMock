# Postman Local Mock

Simple utility that runs a mock api out of an API using a postman collection as a base.

Just download the executable of the lastest version [here](https://github.com/dandimrod/PostmanLocalMock/releases/latest).

Alternatively, you can also clone this repository, and run the program by first downloading the dependencies with:

    npm update

And then run the server with:

    node PostmanLocalMock.js

Node.js is required to use this method.
